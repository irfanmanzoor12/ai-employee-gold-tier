## Task Plan for SAMPLE_TASK.md

### 1. Objective
Complete the review and finalize the sample task file as part of learning about the task management process.

### 2. Analysis
The sample task file provides a way to practice and understand how task files are structured and processed. By reviewing the file, we can ensure the AI understands the task flow and how to handle similar files in future operations.

### 3. Approach
1. **Review the Task File**: Open and read through `SAMPLE_TASK.md` to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Understand Key Sections**: Pay attention to sections like `Task Details`, `Instructions`, and `Notes` to assess how tasks are organized and processed.
3. **Simulate Task Execution**: Assume the role of Claude Code to mentally walk through steps of understanding, planning, taking action, and completing the task.
4. **Identify Improvements**: Note any potential enhancements or questions for real-world application.
5. **Finalize Task**: If everything is understood and the file served its learning purpose, move it to the `Done/` directory or mark it as complete.
6. **Optional Clean-Up**: As this is a demo file, decide if it should be deleted post-review to prevent clutter.

### 4. Required Resources
- Access to the `SAMPLE_TASK.md` file.
- A text editor to view the file.

### 5. Risks & Considerations
- Ensure the understanding from this sample is applicable to real-world scenario tasks.
- Avoid deletions before confirming that the demo is no longer needed.

### 6. Success Criteria
The task is complete when the sample task file has been reviewed, any notes for improvements are noted down, and the file is either moved to the `Done/` folder or appropriately archived.
