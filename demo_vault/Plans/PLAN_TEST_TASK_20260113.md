## Plan.md

### 1. Objective
Develop a user profile page in the web application where users can view and update their information, change their password, and upload a profile picture.

### 2. Analysis
The development of a user profile page involves creating a React component to interface with existing backend endpoints. Users should be able to manage their personal information securely and efficiently. Providing additional functionalities like email verification and password strength indication will enhance user experience.

### 3. Approach

**Step 1: Frontend Setup**
- Initialize a new React component for the user profile page.
- Set up the necessary state variables to manage user data.

**Step 2: Display User Information**
- Fetch current user data from `/api/user/profile` and display name, email, and the "member since" date.

**Step 3: Implement Email Update**
- Create a form to update the email address, with client-side validation for proper formatting.
- Ensure compatibility with the backend endpoint for saving changes.

**Step 4: Implement Password Change**
- Develop a secure password change form, ensuring strong encryption and JWT token authentication.
- Include a password strength indicator as a client-side enhancement.

**Step 5: Implement Profile Picture Upload**
- Set up a file input to allow profile picture uploads, restricting size to 5MB and format to JPG/PNG.
- Implement an optional client-side preview feature for the profile picture before upload.

**Step 6: Enhance with Nice-to-Have Features**
- If time allows, add components for email verification upon change requests.
- Explore integrating a third-party library for a password strength indicator if not already implemented.

**Step 7: Testing and Optimization**
- Conduct thorough testing of all functionalities, focusing on security and user experience.
- Optimize and debug the code as necessary, ensuring compatibility with different browsers and devices.

### 4. Required Resources
- Access to the current codebase and development environment.
- Credentials for API access and testing, including JWT tokens.
- Relevant documentation for the backend API.

### 5. Risks & Considerations
- **Security Risks**: Ensure all forms and data handling adhere to best security practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **User Experience**: Consider usability for users with varying levels of tech proficiency.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The interface should function seamlessly across all major browsers.

### 6. Success Criteria
- The user should be able to view and update their profile information effortlessly.
- Password changes and profile picture uploads should function securely and efficiently.
- All functionalities should be thoroughly tested with both successful and failed states.
- Enhanced features like email verification and password strength indicator are implemented, if feasible within the scope. 

Completion of the task will be gauged by securely implementing all must-have features and testing them successfully.
