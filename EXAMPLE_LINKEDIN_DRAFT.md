## Draft Text

I've noticed something interesting about AI automation projects.

The ones that succeed aren't always the most technically sophisticated.

They're the ones that solve a specific, painful problem for a specific team.

Last week, I spoke with a founder who spent months building a complex AI system.
It could do amazing things. But nobody used it.

Then they pivoted. Same technology, different problem.
They automated the one task their sales team hated most: manual data entry after calls.

Three weeks later, the team won't work without it.

The lesson?

Start with the pain point, not the technology.
Find what's actually blocking your team's productivity.
Then apply AI to remove that specific friction.

The best automation is the one people actually adopt.

What's one repetitive task your team would love to eliminate?

---

## Why This Works

- **Experience-based framing:** Opens with a credible observation, not a sales pitch
- **Storytelling:** Uses a relatable example without naming clients
- **Practical insight:** Provides actionable advice (pain point first, not tech)
- **Subtle positioning:** Demonstrates expertise without saying "hire me"
- **Engagement hook:** Ends with a question to encourage comments
- **Professional tone:** Helpful and credible, not clickbait or aggressive

**Strategic Value:**
- Builds thought leadership
- Attracts founders facing similar challenges
- Opens conversations naturally
- Positions you as experienced practitioner

---

## Optional Variations

**Variation A (shorter):**

I've noticed something about successful AI projects.

They don't start with the coolest technology.
They start with the most painful problem.

Last week: A founder built a complex AI system nobody used.
Pivoted to automate one hated task. Now the team depends on it.

The lesson? Start with pain, not tech.

What repetitive task is blocking your team?

---

**Variation B (more conversational):**

Here's what I've learned about AI automation:

The best projects aren't the most impressive ones.

They're the ones that solve real problems for real people.

I talked to a founder recently who spent months building something technically amazing. Nobody used it because it didn't address actual pain points.

When they refocused on automating the single task their sales team hated most, everything changed.

Adoption was instant. Results were immediate.

The takeaway? Technology is easy. Understanding human needs is hard.

Always start there.

# LinkedIn Draft (NOT POSTED)

## Draft Text

Three years ago, I thought automation meant replacing people.

I was wrong.

The best automation I've seen doesn't eliminate jobs.
It eliminates the parts of jobs people hate.

Data entry. Report generation. Manual scheduling. Repetitive follow-ups.

The work that drains energy without adding value.

When you automate those tasks, something interesting happens:

People have time to do the work they were actually hired for.
The strategic thinking. The creative problem-solving. The human connection.

One client automated their invoice processing last year.
Expected outcome: Faster invoicing.
Unexpected outcome: Their finance team started proactive planning instead of reactive catching-up.

Automation isn't about doing more with less people.

It's about letting people do what they do best.

Have you automated any tasks recently? What surprised you about the results?

---

## Why This Works

- **Challenges common misconception:** Opens with vulnerability and learning
- **Reframes automation positively:** Not about job loss, but job enhancement
- **Concrete examples:** Specific tasks people relate to
- **Unexpected insight:** Finance team outcome shows deeper value
- **Humanistic approach:** Aligns with current concerns about AI and jobs
- **Engagement question:** Invites sharing experiences

**Strategic Value:**
- Addresses common objection to automation
- Positions you as thoughtful, not tech-bro
- Appeals to humane leadership values
- Opens conversation with decision-makers worried about team morale

---

## Optional Variations

**Variation A (shorter):**

Three years ago, I thought automation meant replacing people.

Now I see it differently.

The best automation eliminates the tasks people hate: data entry, manual reports, repetitive admin.

It doesn't replace people. It frees them to do their actual job.

One client automated invoicing. Expected faster billing.
Got something better: Their team shifted from reactive to strategic.

Automation isn't about doing more with fewer people.

It's about letting people do what they do best.

---

**Variation B (more conversational):**

I used to think automation was about cutting headcount.

Completely missed the point.

Good automation doesn't replace people. It removes the soul-crushing parts of their jobs.

Think about it: data entry, manual scheduling, repetitive emails.
Nobody got into their field to do that work.

When you automate those tasks, people finally have time for what matters: strategy, creativity, real problem-solving.

I've seen teams transform. Not because they got smaller, but because they got focused.

The goal isn't efficiency. It's effectiveness.
